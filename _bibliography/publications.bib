  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of security allocation in a networked control system under stealthy attacks in which the system is comprised of interconnected subsystems represented by vertices. A malicious adversary selects a single vertex on which to conduct a stealthy data injection attack to maximally disrupt the local performance while remaining undetected. On the other hand, a defender selects several vertices on which to allocate defense resources against the adversary. First, the objectives of the adversary and the defender with uncertain targets are formulated in probabilistic ways, resulting in an expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks. Next, we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition under which the cost for the defender and the expected worst-case impact of stealthy attacks are bounded. This condition enables the defender to restrict the admissible actions to a subset of available vertex sets. Then, we cast the problem of security allocation in a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework. Finally, the contribution of this paper is highlighted by utilizing the proposed admissible actions of the defender in the context of large-scale networks. A numerical example of a 50-vertex networked control system is presented to validate the obtained results.},

  abstract={Sustained use of critical infrastructure, such as electrical power and water distribution networks, requires efficient management and control. Facilitated by the advancements in computational devices and non-proprietary communication technology, such as the Internet, the efficient operation of critical infrastructure relies on network decomposition into interconnected subsystems, thus forming networked control systems. However, the use of public and pervasive communication channels leaves these systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. Consequently, the critical infrastructure is put at risk of suffering operation disruption and even physical damage that would inflict financial costs as well as pose a hazard to human health. Therefore, security is crucial to the sustained efficient operation of critical infrastructure.

  This thesis develops a framework for evaluating and improving the security of networked control systems in the face of cyber attacks. The considered security problem involves two strategic agents, namely a malicious adversary and a defender, pursuing their specific and conflicting goals. The defender aims to efficiently allocate defense resources with the purpose of detecting malicious activities. Meanwhile, the malicious adversary simultaneously conducts cyber attacks and remains stealthy to the defender. We tackle the security problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework and characterizing its main components: the payoff function, the action space, and the available information for each agent. Especially, the payoff function is characterized based on the output-to-output gain security metric that fully explores the worst-case attack impact. Then, we investigate the properties of the game and how to efficiently compute its equilibrium. Given the combinatorial nature of the defender's actions, one important challenge is to alleviate the computational burden. To overcome this challenge, the thesis contributes several system- and graph-theoretic conditions that enable the defender to shrink the action space, efficiently allocating the defense resources. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical examples.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a secure state estimation scheme with non-periodic asynchronous measurements for linear continuous-time systems under false data attacks on the measurement transmit channel. After sampling the output of the system, a sensor transmits the measurement information in a triple composed of sensor index, time-stamp, and measurement value to the fusion center via vulnerable communication channels. The malicious attacker can corrupt a subset of the sensors through (i) manipulating the time-stamp and measurement value; (ii) blocking transmitted measurement triples; or (iii) injecting fake measurement triples. To deal with such attacks, we propose the design of local estimators based on observability space decomposition, where each local estimator updates the local state and sends it to the fusion center after sampling a measurement. Whenever there is a local update, the fusion center combines all the local states and generates a secure state estimate by adopting the median operator. We prove that local estimators of benign sensors are unbiased with stable covariance. Moreover, the fused central estimation error has bounded expectation and covariance against at most p corrupted sensors as long as the system is 2p-sparse observable. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through an application on a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.},

The networked control system is composed of interconnected agents where each agent is regulated by its local controller over unprotected communication, which leaves the system vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks. To guarantee a given local performance, the defender optimally selects a single agent on which to place a detector at its local controller with the purpose of detecting cyber-attacks. On the other hand, an adversary optimally chooses a single agent on which to conduct a cyber-attack on its input with the aim of maximally worsening the local performance while remaining stealthy to the defender. First, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that the maximal attack impact on the local performance is bounded, which restricts the possible actions of the defender to a subset of available agents. Then, by considering the maximal attack impact on the local performance as a game payoff, we cast the problem of finding optimal actions of the defender and the adversary as a zero-sum game. Finally, with the possible action sets of the defender and the adversary, an algorithm is devoted to determining the Nash equilibria of the zero-sum game that yield the optimal detector placement. The proposed method is illustrated on an IEEE benchmark for power systems.}

	abstract = {This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to address the problem of optimal sensor placement against an adversary in uncertain networked control systems. The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game with two players, namely a malicious adversary and a detector. Given a protected performance vertex, we consider a detector, with uncertain system knowledge, that selects another vertex on which to place a sensor and monitors its output with the aim of detecting the presence of the adversary. On the other hand, the adversary, also with uncertain system knowledge, chooses a single vertex and conducts a cyber-attack on its input. The purpose of the adversary is to drive the attack vertex as to maximally disrupt the protected performance vertex while remaining undetected by the detector. As our first contribution, the game payoff of the above-defined zero-sum game is formulated in terms of the Value-at-Risk of the adversary's impact. However, this game payoff corresponds to an intractable optimization problem. To tackle the problem, we adopt the scenario approach to approximately compute the game payoff. Then, the optimal monitor selection is determined by analyzing the equilibrium of the zero-sum game. The proposed approach is illustrated via a numerical example of a 10-vertex networked control system.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of distributed formation trajectory planning for multi-vehicle systems with collision avoidance among vehicles. Unlike some previous distributed formation trajectory planning methods, our proposed approach offers great flexibility in handling computational tasks for each vehicle when the global formation of all the vehicles changes. It affords the system the ability to adapt to the computational capabilities of the vehicles. Furthermore, global formation constraints can be handled at any selected vehicles. Thus, any formation change can be effectively updated without recomputing all local formations at all the vehicles. To guarantee the above features, we first formulate a dynamic consensus-based optimization problem to achieve desired formations while guaranteeing collision avoidance among vehicles. Then, the optimization problem is effectively solved by ADMM-based or alternating projection-based algorithms, which are also presented. Theoretical analysis is provided not only to ensure the convergence of our method but also to show that the proposed algorithm can surely be implemented in a fully distributed manner. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example of a 9-vehicle system.}

  abstract = {Efficiently planning trajectories for nonholonomic mobile robots in formation tracking is a fundamental yet challenging problem. Nonholonomic constraints, complexity in collision avoidance, and limited computing resources prevent the robots from being practically deployed in realistic applications. This paper addresses these difficulties by modeling each mobile platform as a nonholonomic motion and formulating trajectory planning as an optimization problem using model predictive control (MPC). That is, the optimization problem is subject to both nonholonomic motions and collision avoidance. To reduce computing costs in real time, the nonholonomic constraints are convexified by finding the closest nominal points to the nonholonomic motion, which are then incorporated into a convex optimization problem. Additionally, the predicted values from the previous MPC step are utilized to form linear avoidance conditions for the next step, preventing collisions among robots. The formulated optimization problem is solved by the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) in a distributed manner, which makes the proposed trajectory planning method scalable. More importantly, the convergence of the proposed planning algorithm is theoretically proved while its effectiveness is validated in a synthetic environment.}

In this problem, each agent can exchange the information of its position and velocity with its neighbors via limited communication ability. Our approach provides a new dynamic event triggering mechanism to reduce the number of triggering times while maintaining satisfactory control performance. Further, a novel Lyapunov function is proposed to guarantee that the group of agents asymptotically tracks the desired time-varying formation trajectory. The practical applicability of the event triggering mechanism is also indicated by excluding the Zeno behavior in the proposed control algorithm. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated via illustrative examples of the time-varying formation flight for six quadcopters.}

In this paper, we present a new approach for the design and stability analysis of a quadcopter adaptive trajectory tracking control. Based on the quadcopter nonlinear dynamics model which is obtained by using the Euler–Lagrange approach, the tracking controller is devised via the backstepping control technique. Besides, an adaptive law is proposed to deal with the system parameterized uncertainties and to guarantee that the control input is finite. In addition, the vehicle’s vertical descending acceleration is ensured to not exceed the gravitational acceleration by making use of a barrier Lyapunov function. It is shown that the suitable parameter estimator is stable and the tracking errors are guaranteed to be asymptotically stable simultaneously. By prescribing certain flight conditions, we use numerical simulations to compare the control performance of our method to that of existing approaches. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

  abstract = {Balancing the power supply and demand is one of the most fundamental and important problems for the operation and control of any electric power grid. There are multiple ways to guarantee the supply-demand balance, but in this research we focus on one specific method to facilitate it namely the prediction of electricity consumption, which is widely used by utility companies or system operators. It is known that this prediction is challenging because of many reasons, for example, inexact weather forecasts, uncertain consumers' behaviors, etc. Hence, analytical and linear models of electricity consumption might not be able to deal with such issues well. This paper therefore presents a machine learning-based approach to predict electricity consumption, in which an improved radial basis function neural network (iRBF-NN) is proposed, whose inputs are time sampling points, temperature, and humidity associated with the consumption. The parameters of this iRBF-NN are sought by solving an optimization problem where four types of cost functions are used and compared on their performances and computational costs. Afterward, the derived model is employed to predict the future electricity consumption based on the hourly forecasts of temperature and humidity. Finally, simulation results for realistic data in Tokyo are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.}

To handle the uncertainties in weather forecast and the nonlinearity relation between the electricity consumption and the weather conditions, this paper proposes a Radial Basis Function like Artificial Neural Network (RBF-like ANN) model with temperature, humidity, and sampling times as inputs. Then the Least Absolute Deviation, i.e., the L 1 norm condition, is employed as the optimization cost which is minimized in the model training process. To solve the L 1 optimization problem, two approaches, namely least square (L 2 ) based and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), are utilized and compared. The simulations on real data collected in California shows that the latter approach performs better, and the number of neurons does not affect much to the prediction performance of the latter approach while it does influence on that of the former approach. Further, the proposed RBF-like ANN model equipped with ADMM solving approach provides reasonably good prediction of the electricity consumption in spite of the imprecise weather forecast.}

Secondly, the varying time state feedback controllers are designed to generate actuator torques by using Backstepping technique and Lyapunov direct’s method, in that these are able to guarantee the stability of the whole system including kinematics and dynamics. In addition, the Babarlat’s lemma is used to prove that the proposed tracking errors converge to the origin and the proposed adaptive law is carried on to tackle unknown parameter problem.

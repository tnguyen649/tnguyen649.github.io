# Research
My vision is to develop control theory-based framework for secure networked control systems.

## Security in Networked Control Systems
Sustained use of critical infrastructure, such as electrical power and water distribution networks, requires efficient management and control. Facilitated by the advancements in computational devices and non-proprietary communication technology, such as the Internet, the efficient operation of critical infrastructure relies on network decomposition into interconnected subsystems, thus forming networked control systems. However, the use of public and pervasive communication channels leaves these systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. This theme aims to create novel methodologies to enhance the security and resilience of networked dynamical systems under cyber attacks.

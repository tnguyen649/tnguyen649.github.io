  description: The aim within this theme is to to create novel methodologies addressing cybersecurity problems under uncertainty in learning and control systems. A core element of this research is the development of novel *probabilistic risk metrics* and optimization-based design methods that *jointly consider the impact and the detectability constraints of attacks*, as well as model uncertainty and prior beliefs on the adversary model.

  description:  "Federated machine learning (FedML) has proven to be a suitable approach for privacy-preserving machine learning across a large number of heterogeneous devices. Our group addresses concerns related to security and privacy in federated machine learning against model poisoning and information leakage attacks. The approach is centered around developing new theories and methodologies to achieve two main aims: secure aggregation of local models under poisoning attacks; private distributed aggregation of local models."

  description:  "Artificial pancreas are envisioned medical systems whose function is to automatically regulate the blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, with little to none human initervention. At the core of these systems we have an intellligent device autonomously deciding how much synthetic insulin and glucagon to infuse into the body through infusion pumps, based on data received from sensors located thoughout the body measuring, for instance, blood glucose levels in real-time. Data exchange among the controlling device, the pumps, and the sensors is critical. The whole system must operate safely, even in the presence of adversaries tampering with the communication or devices. \n\nIn this line of research, we develop schemes to monitor the sensor reading to detect anomalies, and distinguish them from natural unknown disturbances, such as meal intakes, physical exercise, among others."

  description:  "Feedback loop delay is known to impose limitations on the achievable performance of control systems. In particular, delays can increase oscillations, reduce regulation accuracy, and may cause destabilization of the control system. Large enough delays may also cause the loss of communication packets between the sensors, the controller, and the actuators, resulting in denial-of-service at the controller. Delays and packet losses are important aspects to be considered in the context of control over wireless communication networks.
Unfortunately, delays can also be induced by malicious cyber-attacks that aim to disrupt the system. In the security context, it is important to understand how delays may be induced by adversaries and how the attacks may be disguised as natural properties of the communication channel. 
Our group investigates novel control-theoretic approaches for understanding, detecting, and mitigating attack-induced delays and packet losses, combining techniques from system identification, anomaly detection, and robust control."

  description:  "Sustained use of critical infrastructure, such as electrical power and water distribution networks, requires efficient management and control. Facilitated by the advancements in computational devices and non-proprietary communication technology, such as the Internet, the efficient operation of critical infrastructure relies on network decomposition into interconnected subsystems, thus forming networked control systems. However, the use of public and pervasive communication channels leaves these systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. This theme aims to create novel methodologies to enhance the security and resilience of networked dynamical systems under cyber attacks."

  description: "Guaranteeing privacy in dynamical networks is particularly important in the pressing concern of privacy in distributed optimization scenarios common in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The intrinsic design of these networks traditionally depends on implicit trust among agents, raising significant privacy issues. We propose a novel approach that integrates control theory and optimization techniques to address these privacy concerns. Our approach aims to refine network architectures and communication protocols, ensuring that the privacy of individual agents is preserved while maintaining the efficacy of collective decision-making processes. This advancement in network design is poised to substantially improve the handling of privacy in dynamical networks, facilitating their reliable and private application in various settings."

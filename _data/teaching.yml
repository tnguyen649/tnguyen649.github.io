- title: "Automatic Control II"
  level: "Master's course"
  location: "Department of IT - Uppsala University"
  term: "Fall 2023, Spring 2023, Fall 2022, Spring 2022"
  teachers: "[Sérgio Pequito](https://www.spequito.com/) and [Hans Roth](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/hn)"
  ILO: "On completion of the course, the student should be able to: determine relations between multivariable dynamic models in form of state space models and transfer functions. Analyse multivariable dynamic systems with respect to stability, sensitivity for disturbances, statistical properties, and controllability and observability. Analyse dynamic systems influenced by noise, and to determine stationary variances for given linear models. Design optimal observers (Kalman filters). Design controllers for linear multivariable systems based on linear quadratic (LQ) control. Account for the principles behind model predictive control (MPC). Evaluate controllers in laboratory work on real processes"
  about: "The course covers both continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems. It includes a sampling of continuous-time systems and an introduction to discrete-time systems. Stochastic processes are introduced and used as models for disturbances, and the Kalman filter is introduced as a tool for estimation and prediction. Based on this, LQ/LQG and MPC are presented as examples of optimal controllers."
